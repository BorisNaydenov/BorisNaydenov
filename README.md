ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BorisNaydenov and  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that bring value. 

ðŸŒ± I like connecting the dots, solving problems and developing business relationships. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: <a href="mailto:borissnaydenov@gmail.com">Email</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/boris-naydenov/">LinkedIn</a> 

  
âš¡ Fun fact: I discovered a mistake in a Finance and Investments student's book. 

âš¡So the "Fun fact" shows my critical thinking skill but is it a fun fact?


 ðŸ‘€ Take a look at my data analysis projects in my repositories.
