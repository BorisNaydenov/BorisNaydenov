ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BorisNaydenov 

ðŸŒ± I like solving problems, analyzing and visualizing data insights, and creating content - from dashboards to ad banners.    

ðŸŒ± I can be an asset by sharpening strategies, developing business relationships, and staying focused on the objectives and milestones.

 ðŸ‘€ Watch my [Introduction](https://youtu.be/Za_QAHPWQnw?si=tH9PpevlxNYDtxPT) in YouTube
 
 ðŸ‘€ Take a look at my data analysis projects in my repositories.

âš¡ Fun fact: I discovered a mistake in a Finance and Investments student's book. 

âš¡So the "Fun fact" shows my critical thinking skill but is it a fun fact?
