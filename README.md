  🌱 I’m soon to be a Master in International Business. My interests span a wide range of topics:

- Marketing: I enjoy exploring consumer behavior, branding, and effective communication strategies. And psychology.                                                                                            
- Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG): I’m committed to sustainability and ethical business practices.
-  Finance and Investments: I’m passionate about understanding financial markets, investment strategies, and economic trends.                                                                     
                                                                             
- Data: I enjoy analyzing data and connecting the dots — whether it’s financial data, market trends, customer or ESG insights.

⚡ Fun fact: I discovered a mistake in a Finance and Investments student's book. 
 
   (So the "Fun fact" shows my critical thinking skill but it is not a fun fact.)
