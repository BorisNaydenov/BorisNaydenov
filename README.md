- 👋 Hi, I’m @BorisNaydenov
- 👀 I’m interested in Networking. On the domain side - Finance and Investments, as well as environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics. I kinda wanna get better at coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning, Management control, and Audit.
  These subjects are part of my Master's degree in International Business.
 - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever brings value. Ideally a Master's thesis with your company?

 - ⚡ Fun fact: I discovered a mistake in a Finance and Investments student's book, that could potentially make me a 100x return. Only if I had discovered the mistake 15 years ago. If 15 years ago I did not find the mistake and invested, I would still make money, but I would not be able to tell how much. And maybe I would not know how to think critically.
