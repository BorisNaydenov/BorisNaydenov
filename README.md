👋 Hi, I’m @BorisNaydenov 

 
  👀 I want to share more about me. My interests span a wide range of topics:

- Finance and Investments: I’m passionate about understanding financial markets, investment strategies, and economic trends.                                                                     
- Marketing: I enjoy exploring consumer behavior, branding, and effective communication strategies.                                                                                           
- Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG): I’m committed to sustainability and ethical business practices.                                                                                 
- Data: I thrive on analyzing data—whether it’s financial data, market trends, customer or ESG insights.

 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning, Management control, and Audit. Soon to be a Master in International Business.

  
 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever brings value. Ideally a Master's thesis with your company?

  ⚡ Fun fact: I discovered a mistake in a Finance and Investments student's book, that could potentially make me a 100x return.
