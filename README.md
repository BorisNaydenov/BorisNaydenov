ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BorisNaydenov and  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that bring value. 

ðŸŒ± I like connecting the dots, solving problems and developing business relationships. 


 
 ðŸ‘€ Watch my [Introduction](https://www.loom.com/share/95ff920cdbb74a68be7bc9529dabd54d?sid=29007d6a-938c-493a-a4e1-0d84d8c25cc5)  in 3 minutes.

 ðŸ‘€ Take a look at my data analysis projects in my repositories.


 
âš¡ Fun fact: I discovered a mistake in a Finance and Investments student's book. 

âš¡So the "Fun fact" shows my critical thinking skill but is it a fun fact?
