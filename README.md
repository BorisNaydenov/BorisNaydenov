 👋 Hi, I’m @BorisNaydenov 

 
 👀 I want to share more about me here. I am interested in  Finance and Investments, as well as environmental,
  
   social and governance (ESG) topics. I want to get better at coding. I have been into Marketing before.

  🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning, Management control, and Audit.
  
  These subjects are part of my Master's degree in International Business.
  💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever brings value. Ideally a Master's thesis with your company?

  ⚡ Fun fact: I discovered a mistake in a Finance and Investments student's book, that could potentially make me a 100x return. Only if I had discovered the mistake 15 years ago. If 15 years ago I did not find the mistake and invested, I would still make money, but I would not be able to tell how much. And maybe I would not know how to think critically.
